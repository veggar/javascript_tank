# javascript_tank

This project demonstrates a simple two player tank game. The original version used direct Canvas calls. It has been refactored to use [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) for rendering and input handling.

Open `index.html` in a browser to run the game. Arrow keys control the first tank and `A/W/S/D` control the second. Use `Alt` and `Ctrl` to fire.
